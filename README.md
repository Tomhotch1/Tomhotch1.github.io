### Professional Self-Assessment
This page exists as a showcase of the learning and work that I’ve done during my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.  Throughout this time, I’ve learned about not just the technical aspects of computer science, but also the more practical elements that dictate how teams can function within an organization and provide value to stakeholders at all levels.  The industry standard in this regard is the Agile Framework, which describes a set of highly iterative steps to quickly produce high quality software.  One aspect of this program that I particularly appreciated was the focus on gathering, defining, and fulfilling user requirements.  Too often software developers fall into the trap of misinterpreting what is being asked of them and having to do substantial re-work as the result of a buggy, subpar, or incomplete deliverable.  Similarly, I learned about how critical security is for developers.  One important technique I practiced was using robust and up to date tools to scan codebases for library versions that contain known vulnerabilities.
